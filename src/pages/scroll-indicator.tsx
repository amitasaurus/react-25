      <div className="text-md text-slate-600">
        The Preamble to the Constitution of India presents the principles of the
        Constitution and indicates the sources of its authority.[1] The preamble
        is based on the Objectives Resolution, which was moved in the
        Constituent Assembly by Jawaharlal Nehru on 13 December 1946 accepted on
        22 January 1947 and adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November
        1949, coming into force on 26 January 1950, celebrated as the Republic
        Day of India. It was amended during the Indian emergency by Indira
        Gandhi where the words "socialist", "secular" and "integrity" were
        added.[2]

      <div className="mb-4 text-2xl text-slate-900">Interpretation</div>
      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Sovereign</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        Sovereign means the independent authority of a State—that it has the
        power to legislate on any subject; and that it is not subject to the
        control of any other State / external power. According to the preamble,
        the constitution of India has been pursuance of the solemn resolution of
        the people of India to constitute India into a 'Sovereign Socialist
        Secular Democratic Republic', and to secure well-defined objects set
        forth in the preamble. Sovereignty denotes supreme and ultimate power.
        It may be real or normal, legal or political, individual or pluralistic.
        In monarchies, sovereignty was vested in the person of monarchs. But in
        republican form of governments, which mostly prevail in the contemporary
        world, sovereignty is shifted to the elected representatives of the
        people. According to D.D Basu, the word 'sovereign' is taken from
        article 5 of the constitution of Ireland. 'Sovereign or supreme power is
        that which is absolute and uncontrolled within its own sphere'. In the
        words of Cooley, "A state is sovereign when there resides within itself
        supreme and absolute power, acknowledging no superior". Sovereignty, in
        short, means the independent authority of a state. It has two aspects-
        external and internal. External sovereignty or sovereignty in
        international law means the independence of a state of the will of other
        states, in her conduct with other states in the committee of nations.
        Sovereign in its relation between states and among states signifies
        independence. The external sovereignty of India means that it can
        acquire foreign territory and also cede any part of the Indian
        territory, subject to limitations (if any) imposed by the constitution.
        On the other hand, internal sovereignty refers to the relationship
        between the states and the individuals within its territory. Internal
        sovereignty relates to internal and domestic affairs, and is divided
        into four organs, namely, the executive, the legislature, the judiciary
        and the administrative. Though India became a sovereign country on 26
        January 1950, having equal status with the other members of the
        international community, she decided to remain in the Commonwealth of
        Nations. Pandit Nehru declared that India will continue – "her full
        membership of the Commonwealth games of Nations and her acceptance of
        the King as the symbol of the free association of the independent
        nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth". Her membership of the
        Commonwealth of Nations and that of the United Nations Organization do
        not affect her sovereignty to any extent. It is merely voluntary
        association of India and it is open to India to cut off this association
        at her will, and that it has no constitutional significance.

      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Socialist</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        Before the term was added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, the
        Constitution had socialist content in the form of certain Directive
        Principles of State Policy. The term socialist used here refers to
        social democracy, i.e. achievement of socialist goals through
        democratic, evolutionary and non-violent means. Essentially, it means
        that (since wealth is generated socially) wealth should be shared
        equally by society through distributive justice, not concentrated in the
        hands of few, and that the government should regulate the ownership of
        land and industry to reduce socio-economic inequalities.[citation

      <br />
      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Secular</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        Secular means that the relationship between the government and religious
        groups are determined according to constitution and law. It separates
        the power of the state and religion. By the 42nd Amendment on December
        18, 1976, the term "Secular" was also incorporated in the Preamble.
        There is no difference of religion i.e. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism,
        Sikhism, Christianity and Islam are equally respected and moreover,
        there is no state religion. All the citizens of India are allowed to
        profess, practice and propagate their religions. Explaining the meaning
        of secularism as adopted by India, Alexander Owics has written,
        "Secularism is a part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution
        and it means equal freedom and respect for all religions stated."[This

      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Democratic</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        The people of India elect their governments by a system of universal
        adult franchise, popularly known as "one person one vote". This
        representative form of government is suitable for governing the country
        because of its huge and diverse population. Every citizen of India 18
        years of age or older and not otherwise debarred by law is entitled to
        vote. In case of Mohan Lal Tripathi vs District Magistrate, the term
        "Democracy" was discussed and it was held that:[citation needed]

      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Republic</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        In a republican form of government, the head of state is elected and not
        a hereditary monarch. Thus, this word denotes a government where no one
        holds public power as a proprietary right. As opposed to a monarchy, in
        which the head of state is appointed on a hereditary basis for life or
        until abdication, a democratic republic is an entity in which the head
        of state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. Thus,
        India has a president who is indirectly elected and has a fixed term of
        office. There is an absence of a privileged class and all public offices
        are open to every citizen without discrimination.

      <br />
      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Justice</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        Justice stands for rule of law, absence of arbitrariness and a system of
        equal rights, freedom and opportunities for all in a society. India
        seeks social, economic and political justice to ensure equality to its
        citizens. (i) Social Justice: Social Justice means the absence of
        socially privileged classes in the society and no discrimination against
        any citizen on grounds of caste, creed, color, religion, gender or place
        of birth. India stands for eliminating all forms of exploitations from
        the society. (ii) Economic Justice: Economic Justice means no
        discrimination between man and woman on the basis of income, wealth and
        economic status. It stands for equitable distribution of wealth,
        economic equalities, the end of monopolistic control over means of
        production and distribution, decentralization of economic resources, and
        the securing of adequate opportunities to all for earning their living.
        (iii) Political Justice: Political justice means equal, free and fair
        opportunities to the people for participation in the political process.
        It stands for the grant of equal political rights to all the people
        without discrimination. The Constitution of India provides for a liberal
        democracy in which all the people have the right and freedom to
        participate.

      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Liberty</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        The idea of Liberty refers to the freedom on the activities of Indian
        nationals. This establishes that there are no unreasonable restrictions
        on Indian citizens in term of what they think, their manner of
        expressions and the way they wish to follow up their thoughts in action.
        However, liberty does not mean freedom to do anything, and it must be
        exercised within the constitutional limits.

      <div className="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-900">Equality</div>
      <div className="text-lg text-slate-600">
        The term 'equality' means the absence of special privilege to any
        section of society, and the provision of adequate opportunity of all the
        individuals without any discrimination.

        The word "Fraternity" is derived from French word which declares that it
        has to assure two things—the dignity of the individual and the unity and
        integrity of the nation. The word 'integrity' has been added to the
        Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976).
